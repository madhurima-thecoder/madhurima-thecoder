## Hi 👋
I am Madhurima, an IT enthusiast with 16+ years of Corporate IT experience in Java development and Salesforce. Recently took a career break after my second baby to spend some quality time with family, pause & reflect and try something different! I explored a business venture (non-IT) for few months. Although a great learning experience, my love for building software brought my focus back to the IT space. I am exploring the Freelance workspace now and recently delivered my first Freelance project (Website & Admin application) - a great opportunity where I learned React and Node Js to build end-to-end application with MS SQL as a database. 

I see myself as a curious and quick learner who loves to learn new technologies and work on varied systems.  Here is a brief summary of my backgroud.
